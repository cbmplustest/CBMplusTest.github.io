Each institution has its specific biorepository management solution. Basic information about specimen collections is rarely shared or easily searchable. The goal for a Common Biorepository Model (CBM) is to reduce the time and effort required by researchers to locate a biobank that has the specimens they need. The CBM does not seek a full data exchange but to selectively share key information to enable a single search across multiple biobanks. The idea behind a CBM builds on the success of the caBIG® effort and makes it easier for repositories to share data on the caGrid. A CBM supports the idea that data should fit a standardized simple domain model as a means to promote sharing. A CBM would define the infrastructure to enable a dynamically updated repository that can be queried as a service. As data is exchanged using CBM, the documentation and quality of biomaterials should by proxy improve. Finally, maintaining a minimal model would support personally identifiable information (PII) compliance. The result is an evolving searchable catalog of basic specimen information that is simple, mutually understood, and community supported.\r\n![](https://tcrnpm.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/30670884/CBM1.png?version=1&modificationDate=1394373732482&api=v2)\r\n\r\nCBM wiki: https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/q1hyAQ\r\n\r\nLoading caTissue data into CBM : https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/HgMpAw\r\n\r\nThe Specimen Resource locator (website): http://biospecimens.cancer.gov/locator\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
